# imagedl

This is a Chrome Extension designed to make it easy to download lots of images from Google Images. Google used to have a nice, unlimited image search API. Unfortunately, they deprecated it. This is my new solution, and seems to be the only way to fetch tons of image results in a way that isn't rate limited.
